- ğŸ“¡ Real-time sensor data simulation (`stream_simulator.py`)
- ğŸ§  ML-based anomaly detection pipeline (`pipeline.py`)
- ğŸ§ª Feature engineering and normalization
- ğŸ“Š Streamlit-powered interactive dashboard (`app.py`)
- âœ… Deployable structure for IoT/Edge use cases
- ğŸ’¡ Lightweight and entirely written in Python


ğŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python 3.9+
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Isolation Forest)
- Streamlit (Dashboard UI)
- JSON for data representation
- (Optional: Docker for deployment)
